<p>Hello! My name is Cerian Kiev Jaime and I am a senior at University of Houston Downtown majoring in Computer Science and have been here since 2023. I plan to graduate this Fall Semester with a bachelor’s degree. My hobbies are playing guitar and going online to find new obscure music and genres of music. I also enjoy programming with specialty in Java, Python, and C#, and am interested in creating websites as I think that the option of being a web programmer is a decent route to go on. By the end of the semester, I would like to create a social media website with my group that can have features that were present on old internet social media sites that are not present today, such as a customizable homepage. I also enjoy developing games in Unity using C#, and I recently took a Game Development class during the summer to expand my knowledge on game development which I really enjoyed as well. I was able to make an endless runner and had alot of fun making it, so I would like to make another game in a different genre. I look forward to the rest of the semester!
